# Hi there, I'm Edwin Rivera 👋  

🌿 **Computer Science + Sustainability**  
Hi! I’m Edwin — a senior at Vanderbilt University studying **Computer Science** with a minor in **Data Science**.  
A passionate software developer at heart, I love building at the intersection of **technology, community, and sustainability** to create a more impactful and equitable society.  

My journey has taken me from interning three times at **Amazon**, building large-scale systems, and leading community projects like the Vanderbilt Housing Platform and GreenLens, an AI tool for recycling detection.

In the midst of a Digital Revolution, I believe technology is the driving force behind solutions to our most pressing challenges — from housing accessibility to environmental sustainability. Whether I’m designing scalable cloud systems, building apps that connect communities, or experimenting with AI for environmental impact, I aim to use my skills to drive meaningful change. 🚀  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new workout routines, enjoying music, or mentoring other students in tech. ☕🎶💡
