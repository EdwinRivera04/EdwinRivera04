# Hi there, I'm Edwin Rivera üëã  

üåø **Computer Science + Sustainability**  
Hi! I‚Äôm Edwin ‚Äî a senior at Vanderbilt University studying **Computer Science** with a minor in **Data Science**.  
A passionate software developer at heart, I love building at the intersection of **technology, community, and sustainability** to create a more impactful and equitable society.  

My journey has taken me from interning three times at **Amazon**, building large-scale systems, and leading community projects like the Vanderbilt Housing Platform and GreenLens, an AI tool for recycling detection.

In the midst of a Digital Revolution, I believe technology is the driving force behind solutions to our most pressing challenges ‚Äî from housing accessibility to environmental sustainability. Whether I‚Äôm designing scalable cloud systems, building apps that connect communities, or experimenting with AI for environmental impact, I aim to use my skills to drive meaningful change. üöÄ  

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me exploring new workout routines, enjoying music, or mentoring other students in tech. ‚òïüé∂üí°
